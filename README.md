# 🐦 Angry Birds - Console Edition (C++)

A simple, physics-based terminal game inspired by Angry Birds, developed using C++. This project was created as a university assignment to demonstrate basic programming concepts like structures, file handling, and game loops.

## 🚀 Features
* **Physics Simulation:** Realistic projectile motion using gravity and angles.
* **Levels:** 3 challenging levels with different wall structures and enemy placements.
* **Bird Types:** * `Normal Bird`: Standard trajectory.
  * `Drop-Kick Bird`: A special bird that can drop vertically when you press **SPACE**.
* **Save System:** Progress is saved automatically in `scores.txt`.
* **Easter Egg:** Try finding the secret code in the menu! 😉

## 🛠️ How to Run [main.cpp]()

1. Download the source code (`main.cpp`).
2. Open it in a C++ IDE (like Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, or Visual Studio).
3. Compile and Run.
4. **Note:** Use a Windows environment as it uses `windows.h` and `conio.h`.

## 🎮 Controls
* **Menu:** Enter numbers (0-3) to navigate.
* **In-Game:** * Enter Angle (0-90) and Speed (0-12).
  * Press **SPACE** for the special ability of the Drop-Kick bird.
  * Press **'q'** to return to the main menu.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `main.cpp`: The core game logic.
* `scores.txt`: Stores your stars and high scores.
